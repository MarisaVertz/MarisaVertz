<h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi! I’m Marisa, a certified web developer and multidisciplinary artist with a background in music, design, and digital storytelling. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Music Production and a Master of Science in Entertainment Business which together have shaped a creative yet strategic approach to building thoughtful, impactful experiences online.</p>
          <p>Professionally, I’ve dedicated my career to a non-profit arts institution since 2017, specializing in web content, design, and development. My focus: crafting digital spaces that blend creativity with user-centered functionality. </p>
          <p>With roots in the arts and a strong eye for detail, I approach web development as both a craft and a form of expression. Whether I’m composing, illustrating, or coding, I bring curiosity, care, and a commitment to creating digital spaces that resonate.</p>
          <p>Away from the keyboard, you’ll find me enjoying my cats, making music, hiking, and drawing inspiration from nature. My curiosity keeps me exploring new ideas and seeking fresh perspectives.</p>
          <p>Let’s build something meaningful together.</p>
